## When a problem is commonplace...

Imagine you're writing up some code for a program one fine day. You've finished a segment and are about to move on to the next when you notice your IDE showing signs of errors in your codes somewhere. Directing your attention to the lines highlighted by the IDE, you take a quick scan and realize that the issue is pretty simple. No worries! Just apply a nifty design pattern and poof! Now it's resolved without having to put as much work into it as you had writing up your code. Throughout my programming times, I've encountered multiple issues that were simple in nature but took me a decent chunk of my time fixing since I solved them one at a time in a unique fashion. Regrettably, this method persisted for a long while, until earlier this year, when I learned of design patterns.

### A tool for said problems

Design patterns were interesting to learn about. They aren't functions or libraries you can just download and plug in for an easy one-and-done fix, but rather guidelines for identifying and solving common problems whereever they're found. Think of them as a specialized help section tailored for coders to reference in their work-to-work day. These design patterns help to expedite bugfixing by providing a structure for fixing a problem in a small amount of time rather than force the coder to divert their brainpower towards identifying and fixing the problem.
