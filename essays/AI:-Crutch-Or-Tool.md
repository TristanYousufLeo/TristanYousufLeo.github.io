### I. Introduction
As Artificial Intelligence (or AI for short) technology exploded in developement over the years, the wider world has had to grapple with the rapidly evolving capabilities of AI and the ensuing consequences arising from said capabilities. Colleges all across the U.S., for example, found a not-insignificant number of their students now submitting papers that would've taken hours of research and typing that are instead written up in mere seconds by an algorithm that was fed a set of instructions and given access to the internet. Gaming companies, such as Riot, have come under fire for using AI-generated pictures, whose image-generating algorithms were built off of thousands of artworks crafted by human hands. And AI has even started to creep into the world of software engineering, with coders now turning to AI-generators such as ChatGPT to turn out new programs wholesale with just a prompt and a few seconds to wait for the AI to do their magic. For myself personally, I have refrained from using AI for almost the entirety of the course, as while the ability to churn out several chunks of code or an entire book's worth of essays was very appealing at first, I realized that growing to rely on such technology would ultimately stunt my growth as a Computer Science student and would not provide the necessary experience that I need for the rigors of practical coding. The extent by which I actually utilized AI technology in this course was limited to only ChatGPT 3.5.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18: I had never seen a use for using AI even for the homework-level WODs, as the homework WODs were not just simple enough to grapple with, but also reflective of my current level of understanding on the subjects presented in the Experience WODs. With the presence of videos also helping with any explanations, the use of AI would not have benefitted me in any way, shape, or form.

  2. In-class Practice WODs: In-class Practice WODs are also in the same range when it comes to the question of whether to use AI as when I was doing the Experience WODs. The presence of teachers and LAs to help with any explanations or problems and the ability to collaborate with my fellow classmates had rendered the usefulness of AI as null for me. Therefore, the thought of using AI had never crossed my mind.

  3. In-class WODs: I had only attempted to use AI once for one WOD and found the experience to be very trying. On that occasion, I had tasked ChatGPT with converting a website to utilize React, but found myself spending more time debugging said website rather than building it. To date, that remains my only experience with using AI in ICS 314.

  4. Essays: Using AI feels wrong on a personal level for me. Essays are meant to allow us to express our thoughts and ideas, and having an algorithm generate an essay from practically thin air based off a prompt would detract greatly from that experience. Hence, I have resolved to never use AI for any essays that I write.

  5. Final project: I have also refrained from using AI technology for my final project, as I have not felt the need nor want to utilize AI since the final project is meant to be the culmination of our learning and efforts in Software Engineering.

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial: I have never thought of using AI for this purpose, but I still see no need to use AI as it would dilute the learning experience greatly for me.

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord: This was also something that I never thought of using AI for as well. All the same, I feel no need nor want to resort to AI for such purposes, both today and in the near-to-far future.

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question: 

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
